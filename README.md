DIP ASSIGNMENT (TASK A)


HOW TO RUN:

- Get all the required files and add them into the same folder (directory)
- Create a program in python in the same folder to execute the code
  
- Files required:
  - office.mp4 
  - alley.mp4 
  - singapore.mp4 
  - traffic.mp4 
  - talking.mp4 
  - watermark1.png 
  - watermark2.png 
  - endscreen.mp4
  - face_detector.xml


All the points in the assignment Task A question and marking rubric are completed except for:

Issues: 
- Not able to correctly determine whether the videos are shot in daytime or night-time (the output shows that all videos are shot in day, hence there is no adjustment/increase of brightness for the videos that were shot at night-time)

- Alpha Channel - the given watermark images do not have an alpha channel, so had to convert the images and make them have alpha channels by removing their background using an online tool - remove.bg. Now the images are saved as “2.png” and “3.png”

Potential Issues:

- There could be ways to avoid some lines of code and make it cleaner and make it avoid hard coding (as stated in the marking rubric)

Improvement that can be made:

- Use simpler comments and make the code more neat
- The overlayed “talking.mp4” video can be positioned better
- The borders of the overlayed “talking.mp4” video can be thinner

Other: 

- Need to go through the code again to see whether there’s anything that needs to be changed and updated
